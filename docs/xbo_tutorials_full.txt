SECTION: HOW TO READ THE ORDER BOOK ON XBO.COM
============================================================

The order book shows all open buy and sell orders for a trading pair, helping you make smarter trading decisions.

Key concepts:
- Bids (buy orders) vs. Asks (sell orders) — bids show demand, asks show supply.
- Spread — the gap between the highest bid and lowest ask. A tight spread means high liquidity.
- Market depth — shows the volume of orders at each price level, indicating potential support and resistance.
- Buy/sell pressure — more bids than asks signals buying pressure (price may rise), and vice versa.
- Market orders execute instantly at the current price; limit orders execute at a price you set.

Tips: Watch the spread for market sentiment. Use limit orders to control your entry/exit price. Avoid large market orders in thin order books to reduce slippage.

XBO.com offers two ways to convert crypto: Trading and Exchange (Swapping).

Trading:
