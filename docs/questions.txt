SECTION: WHAT IS CRYPTOPAYX?
============================================================
CryptoPayX is a crypto processing gateway for receiving crypto deposits and automatically processing them for merchants.

SECTION: HOW IS CRYPTOPAYX DIFFERENT FROM A REGULAR CRYPTO DEPOSIT?
============================================================
CryptoPayX uses a payment intent that contains the exact currency, network, and address. A regular deposit is a standard top-up without an intent.

SECTION: IN WHICH COUNTRIES IS CRYPTOPAYX AVAILABLE?
============================================================
Availability depends on the merchant; some brands may disable the method entirely.

SECTION: WHICH CRYPTOCURRENCIES DOES CRYPTOPAYX SUPPORT?
============================================================
The full list is available via the API endpoint GET /v1/currencies.

SECTION: CAN CRYPTOPAYX BE USED IN A MOBILE APPLICATION?
============================================================
Yes, via Iframe or using the API.

SECTION: WHAT IS A PAYMENT INTENT?
============================================================
It is a payment task that contains the amount, currency, network, address, and deposit status control.

SECTION: HOW DO I CREATE A PAYMENT INTENT?
============================================================
In the CryptoPayX section: XBO → Crypto PayX → Create payment link (or via API).

SECTION: WHY DOES A PAYMENT INTENT HAVE THE STATUS FAILED?
============================================================
The reason is a currency or network mismatch, or a timeout.

SECTION: WHY DOES A PAYMENT INTENT SHOW PARTIALLYCOMPLETED?
============================================================
When there is a minor amount mismatch within the threshold.

SECTION: WHY WAS THE PAYMENT CREDITED AS A REGULAR DEPOSIT INSTEAD OF A PAYMENT INTENT?
============================================================
Because the deposit was sent in a different currency than specified in the payment intent.

SECTION: CAN A PAYMENT INTENT BE REUSED?
============================================================
It depends on the merchant's settings. On a repeated deposit, a new payment intent will be created.

SECTION: CAN THE AMOUNT BE CHANGED IN AN ALREADY CREATED INTENT?
============================================================
No, a new intent must be created.

SECTION: CAN THE ADDRESS BE CHANGED IN AN ALREADY CREATED INTENT?
============================================================
No, the address is generated automatically.

SECTION: HOW DO I CANCEL A PAYMENT INTENT?
============================================================
The status will automatically change to Failed if funds are not received within the set time period.

SECTION: DO I NEED TO REGENERATE THE ADDRESS FOR A SINGLE ADDRESS DEPOSIT?
============================================================
No. The address has no expiration date and is used permanently.

SECTION: DOES THE SINGLE DEPOSIT ADDRESS CHANGE?
============================================================
No, it is a permanent combination of coin + network + address (+memo/tag).

SECTION: WHAT SHOULD I DO IF A DEPOSIT WAS SENT WITH A DIFFERENT COIN OR NETWORK?
============================================================
Such a deposit will not be linked to the intent and may require manual review.

SECTION: CAN ONE ADDRESS BE USED FOR DIFFERENT CURRENCIES?
============================================================
No. Currency, network, and address are a unique combination.

SECTION: IS A DESTINATION TAG / MEMO REQUIRED?
============================================================
Yes, for XRP, XLM, and similar currencies the tag is mandatory.

SECTION: WHAT HAPPENS IF THE TAG WAS MISSED?
============================================================
The deposit will not enter the system; manual processing is required and support must be contacted.

SECTION: WHERE CAN I FIND THE CRYPTOPAYX API KEYS?
============================================================
XBO → Profile → Security → CryptoPayX API.

SECTION: WHY CAN'T A CLIENT CREATE A SANDBOX CRYPTOPAYX API KEY?
============================================================
Because they are in the ClientAPI section. They need to navigate to CryptoPayX API.

SECTION: WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CLIENTAPI AND CRYPTOPAYX API?
============================================================
ClientAPI — for client operations within an account; allows making deposits, withdrawals, conversions, and spot trading. It is a Crypto as a Service product.CryptoPayX API — for crypto payment processing, with the ability to automatically convert incoming funds according to rules set by the Merchant. It also supports the reverse direction — Payout, meaning withdrawing funds to any crypto.

SECTION: IS AN IP WHITELIST REQUIRED FOR CRYPTOPAYX?
============================================================
Yes, CryptoPayX Production requires a whitelist.

SECTION: IS A WHITELIST REQUIRED FOR CLIENTAPI?
============================================================
No. It is never required.

SECTION: IS A WHITELIST REQUIRED FOR SANDBOX?
============================================================
No — Sandbox does not require a whitelist.

SECTION: WHY DOES THE API RETURN 401?
============================================================
Reasons: – incorrect API key; – incorrect signature or timestamp.

SECTION: WHY DOES THE API RETURN NULL?
============================================================
It may be an incorrect endpoint or an incorrect integration configuration.

SECTION: WHERE CAN I FIND THE SANDBOX ENDPOINTS?
============================================================
https://api.sandbox.cryptopayx.tech

SECTION: IS IT NECESSARY TO SPECIFY A CALLBACK URL?
============================================================
Yes, to receive notifications about the transaction status.

SECTION: WHAT IS THE MINIMUM DEPOSIT VIA CRYPTOPAYX?
============================================================
0.5 USD equivalent.

SECTION: WHY IS THE DEPOSIT IN PENDING STATUS?
============================================================
The delay may be in the blockchain or network.

SECTION: WHY HASN'T THE DEPOSIT APPEARED IN THE WALLET?
============================================================
If the currency or network differs from the intent — the deposit goes into the system as a regular deposit.

SECTION: WHY IS THE DEPOSIT NOT SHOWING IN THE CRYPTOPAYX REPORT?
============================================================
Because it was a manual withdrawal or a regular deposit.

SECTION: CAN A DEPOSIT BE MANUALLY LINKED TO AN INTENT?
============================================================
No, deposits are processed according to the system's logic.

SECTION: CAN A MERCHANT RECEIVE AN EMAIL ABOUT A DEPOSIT?
============================================================
In the case of ManualActionRequired, a callback is sent. An email notification may be sent to the payer's email.

SECTION: CAN TEST DEPOSITS BE MADE IN PRODUCTION?
============================================================
Not exactly — but small amounts can be tried. To test a deposit, make a withdrawal to the address obtained for CryptoPay, and for a withdrawal test, do the reverse.
