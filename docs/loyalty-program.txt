SECTION: HOW DOES THE LOYALTY PROGRAM WORK?
============================================================

The XBO loyalty program offers crypto rewards and improved trading and exchanging conditions to clients who actively use the platform. 
The program is based on accumulating experience points (XP). You can get them for completing various actions on the platform, such as passing verification, installing the app, and exchanging cryptocurrencies. Visit the XBO Rewards center to see the full list of actions that bring you XP. 
XPs are a unit of reward for regular everyday actions taken on the XBO.com platform. XPs are the currency you need to unlock higher membership tiers and earn (awesome) rewards.
You can earn XP by:
- Reaching various levels of identity verification (from 100 to 300 XP).
- Logging in daily (10 XP).
- Referring new users to the platform (50 XP).
- Spot-trading (7 XP for every $10).
- Swapping crypto or fiat assets (20 XP for every $20).
- Installing the free mobile app (150 XP).
When you collect enough XP, you move up one loyalty level.
The XBO.com Loyalty program consists of 5 tiers:
- Silver - your starting level once you register successfully.
- Gold - requires 10,000 XP.
- Platinum - requires 65,000 XP. 
- Diamond - requires 650,000 XP. 
- Black Diamond - requires 2,100,000 XP!
Each level gives you additional perks, rewards, and more favorable conditions to exchange and trade crypto.
Each time you move from one tier to the next, you will receive: 
- Improved benefits, including exchange cashback, free monthly fiat withdrawals, favorable spot-trading fees, and XBO.com card upgrades.
- An incremental amount of randomized cryptocurrency rewards.

==============================================================
SECTION: HOW DO FREE PAYMENT CARDS WORK IN THE LOYALTY PROGRAM?
============================================================

Some loyalty tiers include free payment card issuance. The number of free cards you're entitled to depends on your current loyalty tier and is shown on the Loyalty page.
When you request a new card:
- Your tier's free card entitlement is checked
- Your lifetime number of free cards already issued is taken into account
If free entitlement is available, the card is issued with a 0 issuance fee.
If the entitlement is exhausted, the standard card issuance fee applies.
Cards issued in the past are not re-evaluated and are not retroactively treated as free. 

Only cards that were issued with a 0 fee at the time of issuance count toward your lifetime free card usage.
When your loyalty tier changes, your free card entitlement is updated immediately and compared against the total number of free cards already issued.
All zero-fee card issuances appear in your Balance transactions.

==============================================================
SECTION: HOW DO LOYALTY TIERS, XBO TOKENS, AND XP WORK TOGETHER?
============================================================

Your loyalty tier is determined by XP and XBO Token holdings.
Tier requirements include:
- A minimum XP balance
- A minimum XBO Token amount held continuously for a defined number of days
Your eligibility is evaluated daily.
If you qualify for different tiers based on XP and XBO Tokens, the highest tier you are eligible for will be applied.
If you reach a tier based on XBO Tokens, you must continue holding the required token balance to maintain that tier.
If the token requirements are not met, your tier will be based solely on XP.
