SECTION: HOW DO I DEPOSIT FIAT INTO MY ACCOUNT?
==============================================================

To deposit fiat into your XBO.com account, you should enter your XBO.com wallet, select Fiat, and click the Deposit button at the bottom of the screen.

You can fund your account using:

Credit card
Bank transfer

Choose the deposit method you prefer and follow the step-by-step instructions provided. If the transaction is approved, the money will arrive in your account according to the timeline given by your selected deposit method. If the deposit attempt is declined, you'll need to try again or select another deposit method.

============================================================
SECTION: WHICH PAYMENT METHODS DO YOU ACCEPT?

Credit card
Bank transfer

XBO.com is continuously growing and improving. In the future, we may integrate new payment methods into our platform. If this happens, you'll be informed about any changes.

============================================================
SECTION: HOW DO I TRANSFER CRYPTO TO MY XBO.COM ACCOUNT FROM ANOTHER CRYPTO WALLET?
==============================================================

To transfer crypto to your XBO.com account, follow these steps:

Enter your XBO.com wallet and tap Cryptos. You'll see a list of cryptocurrencies our platform supports. Choose the one you'd like to transfer to your account and tap Receive.
From the list of available networks, choose the one you want to use to transfer your crypto. Make sure you choose a network compatible with the currency you want to send.

Please keep in mind that the network you select at this step should be the same as the one you'll select on your outside wallet when finalizing the transfer. Otherwise, your funds may be lost.

Now you'll see a QR code and a Send address (a series of numbers and letters). This is your unique XBO.com crypto address for the cryptocurrency you have chosen.

You have two ways to transfer crypto to your XBO.com account:

Copy your XBO.com Send address. Then log into the crypto wallet from which you want to transfer crypto and paste the address into the Send.
Scan the QR code with your smartphone and follow the instructions.

Scanning the QR code is more convenient if you use different devices for XBO.com and your other crypto wallet. If you access both platforms from the same device, it is better to use the Send address.

============================================================
SECTION: WHAT IS THE CURRENCY OF MY ACCOUNT? HOW DO I CHANGE IT?
==============================================================

The currency of your XBO.com account is USD.

For now, there is no way to change this. Our development team is working on adding more options in the nearest future. We'll keep you up to date.

============================================================
SECTION: HOW CAN I WITHDRAW MY FUNDS?
==============================================================

You can withdraw cryptocurrency or fiat by following these steps:

To transfer cryptocurrency to your personal wallet (e.g., MetaMask, Phantom):

Go to your XBO.com wallet.
Choose the crypto you want to withdraw.
Click Send.
Choose how much you want to withdraw.
Select the network that will process the transaction. Make sure it matches the network of the receiving wallet, or your funds could be lost!
Paste your personal wallet address.
Click Continue to withdraw.
Confirm the transaction with the code sent to your phone number.

You can view the status of the withdrawal process in Transaction history. Once the transaction is processed, the crypto will be delivered to your personal wallet.
